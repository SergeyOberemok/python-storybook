The focus of today’s Office Hours was primarily on Research.
Thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts on this aspect of our business and more.
During the session, I addressed questions on what I learned from my time in Research, monetizing innovation, experimental research, partnering on the chip development process, placing long-term bets, the dissolution of the Environmental Science group, and IBM’s newly-announced partnership with UFC.
I also reinforced the importance of taking time to reflect on your 2024 accomplishments and think about actions you can take to improve.
